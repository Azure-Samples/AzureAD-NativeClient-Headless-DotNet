# Authenticating to Azure AD non-interactively using a username & password or Windows Integrated Authentication

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0) Check it out: 

- https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-iwa-v2 for integrated windows authentication
- https://github.com/azure-samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-console-up-v2 for username/password

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-headless/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
